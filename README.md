2.  üìå Problem Understanding

We needed to create a quiz app with following functionality:

    ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Topic Selection - Choose from multiple quiz topics (Wellness, Tech Trends, etc.)
    ‚Ä¢ AI-Powered Question Generation - Real-time MCQ creation with 4 options per question
    ‚Ä¢ Intuitive Quiz Flow - Navigate seamlessly with Next/Previous buttons and progress tracking
    ‚Ä¢ Smart Feedback System - Receive personalized AI-generated performance feedback
    ‚Ä¢ Answer Review - Detailed analysis of each question with correct answers and explanations
    ‚Ä¢ PDF Export - Download comprehensive quiz reports for offline review
    ‚Ä¢ Fallback Mechanism - Automatic retry logic with OpenTDB API backup for reliability

Assumptions made:

‚Ä¢AI returns valid JSON (retry logic handles malformed outputs).
‚Ä¢Three retry attempts for question generation.
‚Ä¢If AI fails, fallback API: OpenTDB.
‚Ä¢Fixed quiz size: 5 questions per session.
‚Ä¢User‚Äôs answers are tracked locally for simplicity.

3. ü§ñ AI Prompts & Iterations

Initial Prompt (Issue: inconsistent JSON)

> ‚ÄúGenerate 5 MCQs on the topic X. Each must have question, 4 options, correctAnswer.‚Äù

Issue: Sometimes AI added explanations or extra text.

Refined Prompt (Stable JSON)

SCHEMA: const QUESTION_SCHEMA = {
type: "ARRAY",
items: {
type: "OBJECT",
properties: {
question: { type: "STRING" },
options: {
type: "ARRAY",
items: { type: "STRING" }
},
correctAnswer: { type: "STRING" },
description:{type:"STRING"}
},
required: ["question", "options", "correctAnswer","description"],
propertyOrdering: ["question", "options", "correctAnswer","description"],
}
};

> ‚ÄúGenerate exactly 5 MCQs in JSON. Each object must have: question (string), options (array of 4 strings), correctAnswer (string). Do not include any other fields or text outside JSON.‚Äù

Handling Malformed Output

- Added `try/catch` with retries.
- If JSON parse fails, fallback prompt is sent.
- The frontend will attempt thrice.

4.  üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Code Structure
